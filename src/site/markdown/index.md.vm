$h1 Apache Log4j Audit

Log4j-Audit provides a framework for defining audit events and then logging them using Log4j. The framework focuses on
defining the events and providing an easy mechanism for applications to log them, allowing products to provide
consistency and validity to the events that are logged. It does not focus on how the log events are written to a
data store. Log4j itself provides many options for that.

$h2 Features

$h3 Audit Event Catalog

Log4j Audit uses a catalog of events to determine what events can be logged and to validate the events. Java
interfaces are generated from the catalog for applications to use when generating the audit events. A web UI
is provided to edit and manage the catalog but the UI requires a specific user's Git credentials and
so is best run on the local user's computer.

$h3 Dynamic Event Catalog

In addition to the catalog that is managed by the web UI a set of dynamic catalogs can also be used. These catalogs
can be used by multi-tenant applications where each tenant has a different set of events and/or attributes that need
to be logged.

$h3 Audit Service

Non-Java applications can perform audit logging by generating the event data and passing it to an auditing service
where the events will be validated and logged.

$h3 Sample Project

Users of Log4j Audit must provide a Git repository where the audit events will reside which will be used to generate
the Java event interfaces. Log4j Audit provides a sample project that contains a sample catalog file and creates
the Jave interfaces from that file. The project also contains a module that generates a war file containing the
editor for that catalog as well as the REST endpoints to manipulate the dynamic catalogs.

$h2 Requirements

Log4j Audit requires Java 8 and Log4j 2.10.0 or greater.
